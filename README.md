## 💻 Key Topics Covered:
### 1. **Agent-Based Modelling**
- Simulated a population of 1,000 agents over 100 days.
- Incorporated parameters like:
  - Initial infected population: 5 agents.
  - Infection radius: 2 units.
  - Infection probability: 30%.
  - Recovery time: 14 days.

### 2. **Mitigation Strategies**
#### **Vaccination**
- Simulated daily vaccination rates of 0.1%, 0.5%, and 1%.
- Observed reductions in peak and total infections.

#### **Social Distancing**
- Simulated movement reductions of 25%, 50%, and 75%.
- Observed significant flattening of the infection curve.

#### **Combined Strategies**
- Evaluated the synergistic effects of combining vaccination and social distancing.
- Found the highest levels of both strategies to be most effective.

### 3. **Comparative Analysis**
- Compared scenarios with no mitigation, vaccination, social distancing, and combined strategies.
- Highlighted the strengths and limitations of each approach.

## 📊 Key Results:
1. **No Mitigation**:
   - Peak Infections: 448 individuals.
   - Total Infections: 995 individuals.

2. **Vaccination**:
   - Peak Infections: Reduced to 375 individuals at the highest vaccination rate.
   - Total Infections: Reduced to 674 individuals.

3. **Social Distancing**:
   - Peak Infections: Reduced to 223 individuals at the highest level of social distancing.
   - Total Infections: Reduced to 892 individuals.

4. **Combined Strategies**:
   - Peak Infections: Reduced to 155 individuals.
   - Total Infections: Reduced to 170 individuals.

## 🚀 How to Run:
1. Open the MATLAB live script `new_new_epidemic_modelling.mlx`.
2. Configure the parameters as needed (e.g., infection probability, vaccination rate).
3. Run the script to simulate the epidemic and visualize the results.

---

## 📝 Recommendations:
1. **Adopt a Combined Approach**:
   - Combine vaccination and social distancing for maximum effectiveness.

2. **Prioritize Rapid Vaccination**:
   - Increase vaccination rates to reduce total infections significantly.

3. **Implement Social Distancing**:
   - Use as an immediate measure to flatten the infection curve and delay the peak.

4. **Adapt Strategies**:
   - Modify mitigation measures based on the epidemic phase for optimal control.
